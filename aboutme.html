    <h1>About me</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>I am SimplySuperior and I am sick of having to compromise on software for simple everyday tasks.<br>
        I made this website as a place where I can host guides and resources on how to keep yourself safe (kys) and independant on the internet.<br>
        I am not native English so there might me some grammar mistakes but I don't think you'll notice since my grammar/spelling is probably better that of an average American.<br>
        This is the first time I am making a website so this is probably a bit trashy.
