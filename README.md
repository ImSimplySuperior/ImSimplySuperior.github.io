## Wats dis?

This website is supposed to be a place where I can share lists of stuff I use in my personal projects, guides and behind the scenes stuff.
I am also going to display a list of stuff that I believe need more exposure or more people should use like different [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) projects.
